# RomCom  

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)

We have created a tool that embraces a quickly growing trend with creative endeavors today - using computer-driven logic to randomly generate media for people to enjoy. In our case, we have developed a cover generator for romantic literature! The emotional desert of romantic novel covers as they are today will be sure to get a steamy renewal with our easy to use webpage. This RomCom page allows users to generate covers using not only our expertly curated stock images, keywords, and descriptions, but with users own image files or phrases too. Whether it is a user-generated cover or a randomly generated one, the user can then use the save cover button to collect multiple covers for comparison. Once a user has scoured our page, it's their turn to start writing to bring their cover ideas to life!

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)

Repository Available Here: https://github.com/mrlobatoman/romcom\
Step 1: Fork repository\
Step 2: Clone repository onto local machine\
Step 3: In terminal - change directory(cd) into newly cloned directory, can also use Finder to search for index.html\
Step 4: Open index.html file in browser\
Step 5: Click buttons - 'show new random cover button' for inspiration!\

### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)

As we enabled all of our pages to function separately, we noticed that a user is able to pull the form view up on the page directly underneath the saved covers that they have collected. Rather than limiting this in our code, we left it intact because it seemed like a feature that did not prevent the rest of our projects function in any noticable way. 

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)

This project was assigned in week 2 of module 1 for the Frontend Program, Dec 6th. This work was completed between the 6th and the 10th. 

### Contributors:
[//]: <> (Who worked on this application? Link to their GitHubs.)

[Michael Lobato](https://github.com/mrlobatoman)\
[Shane Misra](https://github.com/sdmisra)

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)

### Shane:
1. Familiarizing myself with the git workflow in a higher-stakes environment for mistakes.
2. Learning how to read HTML and CSS syntax well enough to manipulate it via Javascript.
3. Developing good coding habits re: JS styling guide, use of whitespace, etc.a

### Michael:
1. learning what my role might look like as a repeater. I understood how I contributed the first time through mod1, I wanted to make some revisions.
2. Solidifying good gitflow work habits.
3. A better understanding of the DOM overall.

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)

### Shane:
1. I really enjoyed this project overall, it pushed me out of my comfort zone, but I am proud of the balance Michael and I developed with our workflow, results, and respect for eachothers time.
2. There were multiple wins each day of the project, which was in itself a surprise and a sort of bonus momentum and satisfaction.
3. Largest challenge I faced - in iteration 3, feeling unsure of myself when trying to narrow in on a particular reference point for our data. The largest solution was walking away from the problem and the current attempt at solving it, as well as trusting that Michael's rabbit trail elsewhere on the matter could be more successful than mine. It was.


### Michael:
1. Completing every iteration in a timely manner and allowing enough time to enjoy personal activities.
2. My personal biggest wall was iteration 4. We both talked through ideas and explored multiple paths for figuring out what needed to be done. It wasn't until taking an extended break and revisiting the problem with fresh eyes that we were able to figure it out.
3. Still having enough energy to check on other members of the cohort, and see how they're doing, if they have any questions.
